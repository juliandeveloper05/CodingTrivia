Coding Trivia: Matrix Edition 🟢An immersive, high-performance interactive trivia experience reimagined with a Matrix-inspired aesthetic. This project leverages HTML5 Canvas for real-time rendering and pure Vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight, zero-dependency architecture.🚀 OverviewCoding Trivia challenges developers with syntax and logic questions across various languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL, etc.).The Matrix Edition overhaul transforms the standard DOM-based UI into a canvas-driven visualization engine, featuring:Dynamic particle systems.Retro typography.The iconic "digital rain" background effect.🛠 Tech StackComponentTechnologyCoreHTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)RenderingHTML5 Canvas API (2D Context)StylingCSS Custom Properties & Grid LayoutsAssetsFontAwesome (Icons)ArchitectureMonolithic Single-File Component (SFC)✨ Key FeaturesCanvas Rendering Engine: Custom game loop handling 60fps animations, particle effects, and text wrapping.Matrix Rain Algorithm: Procedurally generated character streams using Katakana and Latin glyphs.Responsive Hybrid UI: Canvas background with overlaid, accessible DOM elements for interaction (buttons/inputs) ensuring mobile compatibility.State Management: Class-based game state handling (MENU, PLAYING, FEEDBACK, END).📦 Architecture & OptimizationThis project has been refactored from a multi-file structure into a Single File Architecture for maximum portability and ease of deployment..

Reduced HTTP Requests: By embedding logic and styles, the app requires a single network round-trip to load the core experience.Zero Build Step: No Webpack, Parcel, or complex node_modules required. Runs natively in any modern browser.Performance: All visual heavy-lifting is offloaded to the Canvas API, keeping the DOM tree shallow and performant.🚀 Deployment (Netlify)This project is optimized for deployment on Netlify due to its superior CDN performance and instant rollback capabilities for static assets.Option 1: Git Integration (Recommended)Push this code to your GitHub repository.Log in to Netlify.Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project".Select GitHub and choose this repository.Build Settings: Leave empty (no build command or output directory needed).Click Deploy.Option 2: Drag & Drop Manual DeployLocate the folder containing index.html on your machine.Drag the folder onto the "Sites" tab in the Netlify dashboard.Your site will be live instantly.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome! Please adhere to the following standards:Maintain the class-based structure for MatrixTriviaGame.Ensure all canvas drawing operations are optimized for the animation loop (requestAnimationFrame).Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, Arrow Functions, Classes).📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.<p align="center">Developed with 💻 and ☕ by <a href="https://github.com/juliandeveloper05">pale_codepunk</a></p>
